Please read CLAUDE_FIX_ALL_ISSUES_PROMPT.md and fix all the issues mentioned in it.

The main problems are:
1. Dashboard upload functions (handleDocumentUpload, handleAudioUpload, handleVideoLink) don't call APIs - they just create fake local data
2. "View Full Notes" button doesn't work because IDs are fake
3. Chat page uses window.location.replace instead of router.replace
4. File type support needs to be extended (add Excel .xlsx, CSV, code files, but exclude images/audio/video/compressed files like ChatGPT)

Fix all issues in one go. Make sure:
- All upload functions call the correct APIs (/api/process/file, /api/process/audio, /api/process/video)
- After successful upload, navigate to /dashboard/{sessionId}
- Add loading states and error handling
- Extend file type support in app/api/process/file/route.ts
- Update Dashboard file input accept attribute
- Fix Chat page router usage

Start by reading the detailed prompt file, then implement all fixes.
